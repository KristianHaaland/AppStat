The report analyzes the evolution of CO2 emissions per capita across four country groups: industrialized, developing, emerging, and newly industrialized (NICs) - from 1800 to 2022. The bootstrap method is used to estimate group means and 95% confidence intervals. The method performs reliably across most cases, except for industrialized countries in 1850 and NICs in 2000, where small sample sizes led to unstable distributions. Results show a decline in emissions from industrialized countries in recent decades, while emissions from developing countries continue to rise. This results in a flattening of global mean emissions. Looking ahead, emissions from developing countries are expected to increase unless preventative measures are takenâ€”emphasizing the need for sustainable development strategies that reduce emissions without hindering economic growth.
